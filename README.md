# NetApp® ONTAP® Snapshots — PegaProx Community Plugin

A [PegaProx](https://github.com/PegaProx/project-pegaprox) community plugin that adds VM-consistent NetApp® ONTAP® snapshot management directly to the PegaProx UI — for **NFS**, **iSCSI**, and **NVMe-oF** (NVMe/TCP, NVMe/FC) datastores.

---

## What this plugin does

This plugin connects PegaProx to one or more NetApp ONTAP systems and gives you full snapshot lifecycle management for Proxmox VE — without leaving the PegaProx interface:

- **Snapshot** any VM or set of VMs on a shared ONTAP datastore — crash-consistent, app-consistent (QEMU guest agent), or suspend-based.
- **Restore** individual VMs (SFSR for NFS, LV copy for SAN) or revert an entire datastore to a snapshot in seconds (volume revert).
- **Clone** VMs from any snapshot to a new VMID with fresh MAC addresses.
- **Schedule** automatic snapshots with retention policies, pre/post hooks, and email notifications.
- **Replicate** snapshots to a secondary ONTAP cluster via SnapMirror® and restore or clone directly from the replica — without touching the primary.
- **Provision** new SAN datastores end-to-end (iSCSI and NVMe-oF): ONTAP volume + LUN/namespace + iGroup/subsystem creation, host-side iSCSI/NVMe setup, LVM VG creation, and PVE storage registration — in a single wizard.

All operations run as background jobs with live log streaming. Every snapshot embeds a manifest (VM inventory + configs) that travels inside the ONTAP snapshot, making restores self-contained.

## Platform & Protocol Compatibility

The plugin auto-detects the ONTAP platform (`san_optimized` flag) and adapts the available restore methods accordingly. No manual configuration is needed.

| Platform | Protocol | Snapshot | Single VM Restore | Volume Revert | Clone |
|---|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| FAS / AFF | NFS | ✅ | ✅ SFSR | — | ✅ FlexClone |
| FAS / AFF | iSCSI | ✅ | ✅ LUN clone | ✅ | ✅ LUN clone |
| FAS / AFF | NVMe-oF | ✅ | ✅ NS clone | ✅ | ✅ NS clone |
| ASA | iSCSI | ✅ | ✅ LUN clone | ✅ | ✅ LUN clone |
| ASA | NVMe-oF | ✅ | ✅ Volume clone² | ✅ | ✅ Volume clone² |

**How ASA NVMe single-VM restore/clone works:** Direct namespace clone APIs are not available on ASA (`POST protocols/nvme/namespaces` → 404, `POST storage/volumes` FlexClone → 405). The plugin uses the ONTAP CLI bridge (`POST private/cli/volume/clone`) to create a full volume clone from the snapshot instead. The NVMe namespace inside the clone volume inherits the parent subsystem mapping and becomes immediately visible on the Proxmox hosts as a new block device — exactly what is needed for the LVM `vgimportclone` + `dd` restore/clone flow.

² ASA NVMe uses `POST private/cli/volume/clone` (CLI bridge) instead of the native REST namespace clone. The restore/clone result is identical to iSCSI/FAS/AFF.

```

---

## Installation

### 1. Prerequisites on the PegaProx host

Install required OS packages:

```bash
# Required for password-based SSH (not needed with SSH key auth)
apt install sshpass           # Debian / Ubuntu
# dnf install sshpass         # RHEL / Rocky

# Required for NFS restore/clone operations
mkdir -p /mnt/pegaprox-clone
```

### 2. Create a home directory for the pegaprox user

The PegaProx service runs as the `pegaprox` system user. By default its home is `/usr/lib/pegaprox` (the application directory), which is not suitable for SSH keys. Create a proper home directory:

```bash
# Create home directory
mkdir -p /home/pegaprox
chown pegaprox:pegaprox /home/pegaprox
chmod 750 /home/pegaprox

# Update the user's home path
usermod -d /home/pegaprox pegaprox
```

### 3. Set up SSH authentication for PVE nodes

The plugin connects to each Proxmox VE node via SSH to run LVM, iSCSI, NVMe, and pvesm commands. Choose one of:

**Option A — SSH key (recommended):**
```bash
# Generate a key for the pegaprox user
sudo -u pegaprox ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -N '' -f /home/pegaprox/.ssh/id_ed25519

# Display the public key
cat /home/pegaprox/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

# Add it to root's authorized_keys on every PVE node:
ssh-copy-id -i /home/pegaprox/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub root@<pve-node>
# Repeat for each node
```

The plugin automatically picks up `~/.ssh/id_ed25519` (or `id_ecdsa` / `id_rsa`) when no explicit key is stored in the host settings.

**Option B — Password auth:**  
Enter the root password in Settings → Proxmox Hosts → Add. `sshpass` must be installed (step 1).

### 4. Install the plugin

The plugin directory must be placed inside the `plugins/` subdirectory of your PegaProx installation:

| Install method | PegaProx base directory | Plugin destination |
|---|---|---|
| Source (default) | `/opt/PegaProx` | `/opt/PegaProx/plugins/netapp_storage` |
| APT package | `/var/lib/pegaprox` | `/var/lib/pegaprox/plugins/netapp_storage` |

**From GitHub (recommended):**
```bash
# Adjust the path to match your PegaProx installation
git clone https://github.com/custosonlinux/netapp_storage \
    /opt/PegaProx/plugins/netapp_storage

# Fix ownership (only needed for package/service installs running as pegaprox)
chown -R pegaprox:pegaprox /opt/PegaProx/plugins/netapp_storage
```

**Update an existing installation:**
```bash
cd /opt/PegaProx/plugins/netapp_storage
git pull
```

> **Note:** The GitHub repository root *is* the plugin directory — it contains `manifest.json`, `__init__.py`, `api/`, `core/`, etc. directly.

### 5. Restart PegaProx

```bash
systemctl restart pegaprox
```

### 6. Enable the plugin

In the PegaProx UI: **Settings → Plugins → NetApp Storage → Enable**.

The plugin adds its tables to the central PegaProx database on first load (`/opt/PegaProx/config/pegaprox.db`).

---

## Setup

### 1. ONTAP user

Create a dedicated ONTAP user. The required role depends on which features you use:

**Snapshots and restore only (NFS)** — a role limited to snapshot and file-clone commands is sufficient:
```bash
security login role create -role pegaprox-snap -cmddirname "volume snapshot"             -access all
security login role create -role pegaprox-snap -cmddirname "volume snapshot restore"      -access all
security login role create -role pegaprox-snap -cmddirname "volume snapshot restore-file" -access all
security login role create -role pegaprox-snap -cmddirname "storage/file/clone"           -access all

security login create -user-or-group-name pegaprox \
  -application http -authmethod password -role pegaprox-snap
```

**Full feature set (SAN provisioning, iSCSI/NVMe, SnapMirror)** — requires cluster-admin scope:
```bash
security login create -user-or-group-name pegaprox \
  -application http -authmethod password -role admin
```

> The `admin` role is needed for provisioning operations: creating volumes, LUNs, NVMe subsystems/namespaces, iGroups, and SnapMirror management.

### 2. Add ONTAP endpoint

In the plugin UI under **Settings → NetApp Systems → Add**:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| Name | Friendly label (e.g. `prod-cluster`) |
| Host | Cluster management LIF hostname or IP |
| Username / Password | ONTAP credentials |
| SSL Verify | Recommended: enabled |

### 3. Add Proxmox host

Under **Settings → Proxmox Hosts → Add** — add each Proxmox node or cluster that has datastores backed by ONTAP. Standalone nodes (not in a PVE cluster) are supported.

### 4. Run Auto-Discovery

Under **Settings → Discovery → Run** — the plugin scans your Proxmox hosts for NFS, iSCSI, and NVMe datastores and matches them to ONTAP volumes automatically.

You can also add volume mappings manually if auto-discovery cannot identify the correct mapping.

---

## SAN-specific setup (iSCSI / NVMe-oF)

### snapmanifest LV

SAN datastores (LVM-over-iSCSI or LVM-over-NVMe) do not have a filesystem that can hold manifest files. The plugin uses a small dedicated LV called **snapmanifest** that lives inside the same VG as your VM disks. It is formatted ext4 (64 MB by default) and rides inside every ONTAP snapshot automatically.

After discovery has found your SAN mapping, click **"Setup snapmanifest"** next to the mapping in the Settings tab. This creates and formats the LV. It is a one-time operation per VG.

### Restore methods (SAN)

Two restore methods are available for SAN datastores. The plugin selects the correct options automatically based on platform and protocol.

#### Single VM Restore (iSCSI / NVMe on FAS·AFF, iSCSI / NVMe on ASA)

Restores only the target VM's logical volumes without affecting other VMs on the same datastore:

1. The target VM is stopped.
2. A temporary clone is created from the snapshot on ONTAP (LUN clone for iSCSI; namespace clone for FAS/AFF NVMe; volume clone via CLI bridge for ASA NVMe).
3. The clone is mapped to the Proxmox host.
4. `vgimportclone` imports the clone's LVM VG under a temporary name.
5. Each disk LV of the target VM is copied (`dd bs=512M iflag=direct oflag=direct`) from the temporary VG to the live VG.
6. The temporary clone is unmapped and deleted from ONTAP.
7. The VM config is restored from the plugin database.
8. The VM is started.

Other VMs on the same datastore remain running throughout.

#### VM Clone (SAN)

Creates a new VM from a snapshot with a new VMID and freshly generated MAC addresses:

1. A temporary ONTAP clone is created from the snapshot.
2. `vgimportclone` imports the clone VG and reads the snapmanifest to discover disk layout.
3. New LVs are created in the live VG and the disks are copied via `dd`.
4. A new VM config is written with remapped disk references and regenerated MACs.
5. The temporary clone is cleaned up.

The VMID is reserved in PVE immediately before the disk copy begins to prevent ID conflicts during long-running operations.

#### DR Restore from SnapMirror Secondary (iSCSI)

Restores a VM directly from a SnapMirror replicated snapshot on the secondary ONTAP cluster, without touching the primary:

1. The target VM is stopped.
2. A temporary VMID placeholder config is written to PVE immediately to reserve the VMID.
3. A FlexClone is created from the replicated snapshot on the **secondary** ONTAP cluster.
4. A temporary iGroup is created and the clone LUN is mapped.
5. The Proxmox host establishes a **single-path** iSCSI connection to a secondary LIF.
6. `vgimportclone` imports the clone VG under a temporary name.
7. Each target VM disk LV is copied (`dd`) from the temporary secondary VG to the **primary** VG.
8. The temporary iSCSI connection is disconnected and the clone and iGroup are removed from the secondary.
9. The VM config is restored and the VM is started.

> **Single-path iSCSI note:** DR connections use a single LIF on the secondary — multipath is not active for this path. With `find_multipaths yes` in multipath.conf, no `/dev/mapper/<WWID>` device is created. The plugin detects the device via `/dev/disk/by-id/scsi-<WWID>` as fallback.

#### DR Clone from SnapMirror Secondary (iSCSI)

Same as DR Restore, but instead of overwriting the original VM's disks, creates a new VM with a new VMID and freshly generated MAC addresses. Disk LVs are remapped to the new VMID automatically.

#### Volume Revert (all SAN, including ASA NVMe)

Reverts the entire ONTAP volume to the snapshot state — affects **all VMs** on that datastore:

1. The target VM is stopped.
2. The LVM VG is deactivated on the Proxmox host (`vgchange -an`).
3. ONTAP reverts the entire volume to the snapshot state.
4. The VG is re-scanned and reactivated (`pvscan --cache && vgchange -ay`).
5. The VM config is restored from the plugin database.
6. The VM is started.

> ⚠️ **Volume Revert is destructive**: all data written to the volume *after* the snapshot is permanently lost. All VMs on the same SAN datastore are affected.

---

## Storage Provisioning (NFS / iSCSI / NVMe-oF)

The **Provisioning** tab automates the complete setup of a new datastore — from ONTAP object creation to PVE storage registration — across all cluster nodes in a single operation.

### What is automated

**NFS:**
1. **ONTAP side** — create (or reuse) a volume, create a dedicated export policy, and add per-host export rules (the host's IP that routes to the NFS LIF is detected automatically).
2. **PVE cluster** — `pvesm add nfs` (cluster-wide, run once via pmxcfs).
3. **Snapmanifest directory** — `.netapp-snapmanifest/` is created inside the mount point so snapshot manifests work immediately.

**iSCSI:**
1. **ONTAP side** — create (or reuse) a thin-provisioned SAN volume, a LUN, and an iGroup; add all selected host IQNs; map the LUN to the iGroup.
2. **Per PVE host** — iSCSI discovery (`iscsiadm -m discovery`), target login, multipath device detection (waits until `/dev/mapper/<WWID>` appears).
3. **First host** — `pvcreate`, `vgcreate` (linear or thin-provisioned LVM).
4. **All hosts** — `pvscan --cache -aay` to populate the LVM event cache so the VG activates on every node.
5. **PVE cluster** — `pvesm add lvm / lvmthin` (cluster-wide, run once).

**NVMe-oF:**
1. **ONTAP side** — create (or reuse) a namespace and NVMe subsystem; add all selected host NQNs; map the namespace. Supports both standard AFF/FAS platforms and ASA (All-Flash SAN Array) with automatic API fallback.
2. **Per PVE host** — `nvme connect-all` (with automatic timeout handling for non-DDC LIFs), namespace rescan, wait for block device.
3. **First host** — `pvcreate`, `vgcreate`, snapmanifest LV initialization.
4. **All hosts** — `pvscan --cache -aay` VG activation.
5. **PVE cluster** — `pvesm add lvm / lvmthin` (cluster-wide, run once).

### Resize datastore

Resize runs as a background job and is non-disruptive for VMs that are running.

**NFS — grow or shrink:**
1. ONTAP volume is resized to the new size.
2. No host-side action needed — the NFS client sees the updated size immediately through the existing mount.

**iSCSI — grow only:**
1. ONTAP volume is resized to `new_size × san_volume_multiplier` (default 2.5×, configurable in `config.json`). The extra headroom accommodates ONTAP snapshots taken after the resize. Costs no physical space on thin-provisioned volumes.
2. LUN is resized to `new_size`.
3. Per PVE host — SCSI bus rescan (`/sys/class/scsi_device/*/device/rescan`, `udevadm settle`), `multipath` table reload, `multipathd resize map`, `pvresize` on the multipath device, `pvscan --cache`.

**NVMe-oF — grow only:**
1. ONTAP volume is resized to `new_size × san_volume_multiplier` (default 2.5×, same as iSCSI).
2. NVMe namespace is resized to `new_size`.
3. Per PVE host — NVMe namespace rescan, `pvresize` on each PV belonging to the VG, `pvscan --cache`.

The `san_volume_multiplier` (default `2.5`) applies to both initial provisioning and resize. On thin-provisioned volumes the extra ONTAP volume capacity is not physically allocated until written, so the overhead is free until snapshots consume it.

After a SAN resize, `pvresize` makes the extra space available to LVM. To expose it to VMs, extend the desired LV (`lvextend`) and resize the filesystem inside the VM afterwards.

### Remove datastore

The Provisioning tab also handles teardown: `pvesm remove`, VG deactivation and removal, iSCSI logout / NVMe disconnect — and optionally deletes the ONTAP LUN/namespace and volume.

### Requirements

- **NFS:** No additional packages required on PVE nodes.
- **iSCSI:** `open-iscsi`, `multipath-tools`, `lvm2` on all PVE nodes.
- **NVMe-oF:** `nvme-cli`, `lvm2`, kernel module `nvme-tcp` on all PVE nodes.
- A valid `/etc/multipath.conf` with NetApp settings on all PVE nodes (see template below; required for iSCSI).
- SSH access from PegaProx to all PVE nodes (configured under Settings → Proxmox Hosts).

---

## SAN datastore — multi-host manual setup (NVMe-oF)

If you prefer to configure NVMe-oF connectivity manually before using the Provisioning tab, follow these steps.

### multipath.conf — NetApp recommended settings

Required on every PVE node for iSCSI. Add to `/etc/multipath.conf`:

```
defaults {
    find_multipaths    yes
    user_friendly_names yes
}
devices {
    device {
        vendor                "NETAPP"
        product               "LUN.*"
        path_grouping_policy  group_by_prio
        prio                  alua
        hardware_handler      "1 alua"
        failback              immediate
        path_checker          tur
        no_path_retry         queue
        features              "3 queue_if_no_path pg_init_retries 50"
        rr_weight             uniform
        rr_min_io_rq          1
    }
}
```

After writing: `systemctl restart multipathd`.

### NVMe-oF — discovery.conf

NVMe/TCP connections are configured in `/etc/nvme/discovery.conf`, one entry per target/interface pair:

```
--transport=tcp --traddr=<target_ip> --host-iface=<nic> --host-traddr=<host_ip>
```

After editing, reconnect with `nvme connect-all`. The same LVM VG activation step (`pvscan --cache -aay`) applies for NVMe-backed LVM VGs on secondary hosts.

> **Note:** Some ONTAP ASA deployments only expose a Discovery Domain Controller (DDC, port 8009) on a subset of LIFs. `nvme connect-all` may hang indefinitely trying to discover on non-DDC LIFs. The plugin's provisioning flow handles this automatically via a `timeout` wrapper. If you run `nvme connect-all` manually, use `timeout 30 nvme connect-all` to prevent hangs.

---

## Email notifications

Each schedule can send email notifications on snapshot job completion. Configure SMTP in **Settings → SMTP** first, then enable notifications per schedule:

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| Enable notifications | Master toggle per schedule |
| Notify on | All events / Failures only / Success only |
| Recipients | Comma-separated email addresses |
| Send test email | Sends a test email using the current SMTP settings and the entered recipients |

Notifications are sent as HTML emails with a plain-text fallback. The email format includes:

- **Status banner** (full-width, colour-coded): green for success, amber for success-with-warnings, red for failure.
- **Summary table** — schedule name, snapshot name, datastore, status dot, and the list of snapshotted VMs. Each VM is shown as a colour-coded badge including VMID, display name, and type (QEMU / LXC).
- **Dark terminal log block** — last 50 job log lines with per-line severity tags:
  - `[INFO]` — informational
  - `[WARN]` — warnings (amber)
  - `[ERR]` — errors (red)
- **Plain-text fallback** — included as a `text/plain` MIME part for clients that don't render HTML.

The banner colour is determined by the overall outcome: `done` with no warnings → green; `done` with at least one warning → amber; `failed` or any error → red.

---

## Job management

All snapshot, restore, and clone operations run as background jobs and are visible under **Jobs & History**.

- **Cancel**: Running jobs can be cancelled via the Cancel button. The job stops at the next safe checkpoint (between steps or between disk copies). Any partial work (temporary ONTAP clones, imported VGs, reserved VMIDs) is cleaned up automatically.
- **Delete**: Completed, failed, or cancelled jobs can be deleted individually or in bulk via "Cleanup".
- **Stale jobs**: If a job is stuck at "running" after a PegaProx restart (the job thread is gone but the DB entry was not updated), the Cancel button will detect the dead thread and immediately mark the job as cancelled.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Stale iSCSI clone LUN after a failed job

If a clone or restore job fails after the temporary ONTAP LUN has been mapped to the Proxmox host but before cleanup completes, the host may be left with a stale multipath device. Because the NetApp multipath configuration uses `no_path_retry queue`, any process that touches the lost device — including LVM (`vgs`, `pvs`) — will **hang indefinitely**.

**Symptoms:**
- `vgs`, `pvs`, or any LVM command hangs on the affected host
- `multipath -ll` shows a device with all paths in `failed faulty running` state
- The ONTAP volume still exists (visible in System Manager or CLI) but the LUN is no longer mapped

**Cleanup — run on every affected PVE host:**

1. **Identify the stale WWID:**
   ```bash
   multipath -ll | grep -B1 'failed faulty'
   # Note the WWID, e.g.: 3600a098038323449383f5a38746e4842
   ```

2. **Disable I/O queuing** — this unblocks any hanging LVM commands immediately:
   ```bash
   multipathd disablequeueing map 3600a098038323449383f5a38746e4842
   ```

3. **Flush the multipath device:**
   ```bash
   multipath -f 3600a098038323449383f5a38746e4842
   ```

4. **Remove the stale SCSI paths** (replace `sdl sdk sdm sdn` with the actual device names shown by `multipath -ll`):
   ```bash
   for d in sdl sdk sdm sdn; do
     echo 1 > /sys/block/$d/device/delete
   done
   ```

5. **Delete the temporary ONTAP clone volume** (`pgxclone_*`) via ONTAP System Manager or CLI:
   ```bash
   # ONTAP CLI:
   vol delete -vserver <svm> -volume pgxclone_<uuid> -foreground true
   ```

6. **Verify cleanup:**
   ```bash
   multipath -ll    # stale WWID must be gone
   vgs              # must return immediately without hanging
   ```

> **Why does this happen?** The `queue_if_no_path` feature in the NetApp multipath configuration keeps I/O queued in kernel memory when all paths to a LUN are lost — this prevents data loss during transient network outages but also means any process accessing the device blocks until paths return or the device is explicitly flushed. The plugin flushes stale devices automatically at the end of every job. This manual procedure is only needed if the automatic cleanup itself failed (e.g. due to an ONTAP API timeout or network error during the cleanup step).

---

## Performance — SAN disk copy

The `dd` copy used during Single VM Restore and VM Clone is tuned for NVMe storage and high-bandwidth networks:

```
dd if=<src_lv> of=<dst_lv> bs=512M iflag=direct oflag=direct conv=fsync
```

- **`bs=512M`** — large blocks minimize syscall overhead.
- **`iflag=direct oflag=direct`** — O_DIRECT on both sides bypasses the page cache and lets NVMe saturate the full device bandwidth without wasting RAM.
- **Timeout: 4 hours** — covers very large volumes even at constrained throughput.

> **DR iSCSI throughput:** During DR restore/clone from a SnapMirror secondary, the `dd` copy runs across clusters — data flows from the secondary ONTAP cluster to the primary VG over the production network. Throughput is bounded by the inter-site link bandwidth, not by local NVMe/iSCSI speed. For large VMs over limited WAN links, DR operations can take significantly longer than primary restores.

| `san_volume_multiplier` | `2.5` | ONTAP volume size = LUN/namespace size × this factor. Leaves headroom for snapshots. Applies to iSCSI and NVMe-oF provisioning and resize. |

## Naming conventions

All internal names created by the plugin follow the patterns below. This makes it easy to identify plugin-owned objects on ONTAP and on Proxmox hosts, and to clean up manually if needed.

### ONTAP snapshot names

| Type | Pattern | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Manual snapshot | `{prefix}{user_input}` | `NPP_before_update` |
| Scheduled snapshot | `{prefix}{YYYYMMDD}_{HHMM}[_{schedule_name}]` | `NPP_20260507_1400_nightly` |

`prefix` defaults to `NPP_` and is configurable via `snapshot_prefix` in `config.json`.

### Temporary ONTAP objects (FlexClone volumes, LUNs, namespaces)

All temporary objects that the plugin creates on ONTAP during a clone or restore operation use the same prefix: **`pgxclone_`**. They are deleted automatically when the job completes (or fails).

| Object | Pattern | Example |
|---|---|---|
| NFS FlexClone volume | `pgxclone_{job_id[:8]}` | `pgxclone_ab12cd34` |
| NFS FlexClone junction path | `/{clone_name}` | `/pgxclone_ab12cd34` |
| iSCSI temporary LUN (primary restore/clone) | `pgxclone_{job_id[:8]}` | `pgxclone_ab12cd34` |
| NVMe temporary namespace | `pgxclone_{job_id[:8]}` | `pgxclone_ab12cd34` |
| Full ONTAP LUN/NS path | `/vol/{volume_name}/{clone_name}` | `/vol/proxvol01/pgxclone_ab12cd34` |
| iSCSI DR FlexClone volume (on secondary) | `pgxdrclone_{job_id[:8]}` | `pgxdrclone_ab12cd34` |
| iSCSI DR temporary iGroup (on secondary) | `pgxdr_{job_id[:8]}` | `pgxdr_ab12cd34` |

The `pgxclone_` prefix (short, no hyphens, no special characters) was chosen because ONTAP LUN path components do not reliably allow hyphens on all platforms (notably ASA). The `pgxdrclone_` and `pgxdr_` prefixes follow the same convention for DR objects created on the secondary cluster.

### Local temporary mount points on PVE nodes

These are local directories only — they never appear in ONTAP.

| Purpose | Pattern | Example |
|---|---|---|
| FlexClone NFS mount | `{flexclone_mount_base}/{clone_name}` | `/mnt/pegaprox-clone/pgxclone_ab12cd34` |
| DR restore NFS mount | `{flexclone_mount_base}/dr-{job_id[:8]}` | `/mnt/pegaprox-clone/dr-ab12cd34` |
| DR clone NFS mount | `{flexclone_mount_base}/dr-clone-{job_id[:8]}` | `/mnt/pegaprox-clone/dr-clone-ab12cd34` |

`flexclone_mount_base` defaults to `/mnt/pegaprox-clone`.

### SAN: LVM objects on Proxmox

| Object | Pattern | Example |
|---|---|---|
| snapmanifest LV | `netapp_snapmanifest` | fixed name, configurable via `snapmanifest_lv_name` |
| Temp mount point for snapmanifest write | `/tmp/.pgsi_{random[:10]}` | `/tmp/.pgsi_3f8a2c1b4e` |
| Imported temp VG (vgimportclone) | `{vg_name}` or `{vg_name}1` | `proxvg1` (suffix added by LVM if name collides) |

The temp VG name after `vgimportclone` is chosen by LVM automatically: it tries the base VG name and appends an incrementing number on collision.

### NFS manifest storage

| Object | Pattern | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Manifest directory | `{nfs_mount}/{manifest_subdir}/{snap_name}/` | `/mnt/nfs/.netapp-snapmanifest/NPP_20260507_1400/` |
| Manifest file | `…/manifest.json` | |
| VM config at snapshot time | `…/{vmid}.conf` | `…/100.conf` |

`manifest_subdir` defaults to `.netapp-snapmanifest`. Configurable in `config.json`.

### `manifest_path` prefixes (stored in DB)

The `manifest_path` column in `netapp_snapshots` uses a prefix to indicate where the manifest lives:

| Prefix | Meaning |
|---|---|
| *(plain file path)* | NFS — manifest is on the NFS datastore |
| `db:{snapshot_id}` | DB-only fallback (NFS write failed, or not applicable) |
| `snapmanifest:{vg}/{lv}/{snap_name}` | SAN — manifest is on the snapmanifest LV **and** in the DB |

### Default VM names for cloned VMs

When no name is provided by the user, the plugin generates a default:

| Clone type | Default name |
|---|---|
| NFS clone | `clone-{original_vm_name}` |
| SAN clone | `san-clone-{original_vm_name}` |
| DR clone | `dr-clone-{original_vm_name}` |

---

## Consistency levels

| Level | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `crash` | Snapshot taken immediately — fastest, crash-consistent |
| `app` | QEMU Guest Agent `fsfreeze-freeze` before snapshot, `fsfreeze-thaw` after |
| `suspend` | VM suspended before snapshot, resumed after |

LXC containers: only `crash` is supported (no guest agent).

> ⚠️ **One-datastore-per-VM requirement**: The plugin snapshots an entire ONTAP volume at once. A VM whose disks are spread across **multiple datastores** (backed by different ONTAP volumes) will only have the disks on the currently selected datastore included in the snapshot. The other volumes are not snapshotted simultaneously, so the resulting snapshot set is not crash-consistent across volumes. For reliable snapshots and restores, keep all disks of a VM on the same datastore.

---

## Manifest

### NFS

Every plugin-managed NFS snapshot stores metadata inside the NFS datastore:

```
<nfs_mount_path>/.netapp-snapmanifest/<snap-name>/
  manifest.json    snapshot metadata + VM inventory
  100.conf         Proxmox config of VM 100 at snapshot time
  101.conf         …
```

### SAN (iSCSI / NVMe-oF)

The manifest is written to the **snapmanifest LV** (a dedicated 64 MB ext4 LV in the same VG) before each ONTAP snapshot is created. This ensures the manifest travels inside the snapshot and is available for restore:

```
/dev/{vg}/netapp_snapmanifest  (ext4, 64 MB)
  manifest.json
  vmconfigs/100.conf
  vmconfigs/101.conf
```

Additionally, the manifest is always stored in the plugin database as a fallback.

**ONTAP-native snapshots** (not created by the plugin) also contain the snapmanifest LV at the state it was in when the snapshot was taken (i.e. the last plugin-managed snapshot's manifest). The plugin reads this manifest during restore and clone to determine disk layout without relying on the current VM configuration.
